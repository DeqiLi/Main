This PHP code is to parse the content of HTML of a webpage, and then build a JSON treeview for this content.

Now it is under debugging and can only parse the Putti testing site: http://testing.moacreative.com/job_interview/php/index.html

To run the code, we need to put JsonParse.php, jstree.min.js and style.min.css in the same folder.

New version is coming soon.
