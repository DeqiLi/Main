This PHP code is to parse the content of HTML of a webpage given its URL as input, and then build a JSON treeview for this content.
To run the code, we need to put HTML2JsonTree.php, jstree.min.js and style.min.css in the same folder (e.g., /var/www/html). 

This code has been tested under Ubuntu 14.10.

Note: This code can correct syntax error for some, but not all, unrestricted HTML of some websites. So we 
cannot give the Json Tree views for some websites with serious syntax erros.
