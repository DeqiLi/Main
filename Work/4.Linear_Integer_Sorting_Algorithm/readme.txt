This code includes the implementation of the linear integer sorting algorithm which I invented independently in 1997 and published in 2001(Probably it was also found by others).

Advantages of this algorithm:
1. It runs in time O(n), faster than common sorting algorithms such as quicksort;
2. It is simple to implement. It involves only a few lines of code.
3. It is quite suitable to a large number of integers to be sorted.

Disadvantages:
1. It can only sort integers.
