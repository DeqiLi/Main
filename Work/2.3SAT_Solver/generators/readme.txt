Here are five random 3SAT formula generators.

g3 and generator are 3SAT generators for Deqi's SAT60 solver.
g3 generates a random 3SAT formula which has at least one solution(s);
generator generates a random 3SAT formula which may or may not has one solution(s);

g3satcnf and gSATCNF are 3SAT generators in CNF format and both generate random 3SAT formula with at least one solutions.

gSATCNF guarantees that no repeated literals in any clause and
no repeated clauses in the formula.

The difference between g3satcnf and gSATCNF has not been clear, but could be that the formula generated by gSATCNF is more difficult to solve(because of more even distributed literals).

gUNSATCNF can generate 3SAT instances that could have or have no solutions. 

Their usage: 
e.g.,
gSATCNF 100 430 > 3sat9.txt

g3 and g3satcnf is modified by me based on G3.c written by a Japanese(sorry, now I cannot find the author and the source from Internet).
