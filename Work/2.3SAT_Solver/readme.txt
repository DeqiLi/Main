SAT60 is a 3SAT solver.It can solve hard instances of at most 300 variables in from half hour to two hours on average.

The code is based on my own algorithm.

The algorithm is deterministic, which means that, unlike probabilistic algorithms, the correctness of the output is guaranted.This is good news.

The bad news is that it is not competitive with probabilistic algorithms such as WalkSAT and the Survey Propagation algorithm in performance.
